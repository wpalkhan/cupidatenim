/// Draws elements in front of this view, stacked in the order that you list them.
///
/// This function allows you to specify multiple elements to be drawn in front
/// of the current view. The elements will be layered such that the first element
/// in the list is drawn first (closest to the base layer), and each subsequent
/// element is drawn on top of the previous one.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `elements`: An array or list of elements to be drawn in front of the view.
///               Each element should be an object or structure that supports
///               drawing/rendering operations.
